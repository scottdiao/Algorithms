//There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.
//
//Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
//
//Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?
//
//For example:
//
//2, [[1,0]]
//There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
//
//2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
//There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
//
//Note:
//The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
//You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
